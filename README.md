# Node-Mongoose-Project

This is my Node project using the Moongose database, Here I just simply showed the basic things in this Project.
How to do Add/Delete/Edit products in the Websites as well as in the database also, I am showing this thing in this Project.



## Lessons Learned

When I did this project that's time I learned about JavaScript, NodeJs,
 ExpressJs, HTML, CSS, PUG, Handlebars, EJS, and Mongoose DataBase. One
  more thing Here **"npm"** is the most vital thing that's why I also go
   through the **npm** official website and learned from there.
   
 
#### About Mongoose: -

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in
code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.


#### About MongoDb: -

MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database. It means you can store JSON documents in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL databases. 
This is one of the advantages of using NoSQL as it speeds up application development and reduces the complexity of deployments.
